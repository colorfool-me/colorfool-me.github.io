Hey there, my name is Matthias Hoyer. I'm a full stack developer working as Tech Lead at the Stylight website team.

On the side I co-founded [Ammazing](http://www.ammazing.de) & the former web-to-print magazine called [Temp Magazine](http://www.designmadeingermany.de/2011/26623/).

I made my diploma in [Media Informatics at the LMU](http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de) & wrote my thesis at [BMW â€“ Research and Technology](https://www.bmwgroup.com/de.html?http://www.bmwgroup.com/d/0_0_www_bmwgroup_com/forschung_entwicklung/menschen_netzwerke/innovationsnetzwerk/forschung_technik/forschung_technik.html).
